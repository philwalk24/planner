## Description
This app is a very simple note taking app. Saves the notes you take into local storage. Deleting notes is not implemented i dont think.

## Installation
Simply clone the github repo and run npm i in the root. Then, node server.js gets the party started.
## Usage
Once you click the Get Started button you can begin!

## Testing
The testing was done incrementally. Developing a little piece at a time by checking each route individually.

## Credits
The module 11 challenge folder helped me fix what i couldn't figure out months ago. I also used some express documentation because I had forgotten some of the syntax.
